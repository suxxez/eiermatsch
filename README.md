# Eiermatsch

This is a simple web-based implementation of the "Eiermatsch" party game.

[You can read the rules here (in german).](https://www.spielkult.de/eiermatsch.htm)

Basically it works like this:

While the countdown is running, everybody one after another has to say a term that fits to a category. For example "stuff you can eat for breakfast" or "programming language". 

When the countdown randomly ends, the person who currently has to say something has "lost". That means he has to take a shot or do something else, that is up to you!
